## Introduction

`clGENE` is an innovative R package designed for the comprehensive analysis of various omics data. It facilitates the integrated analysis of multi-omics datasets, aiming to assist researchers in exploring the potential molecular mechanisms that underpin similar phenotypes across different diseases.

## Features

- **Standardized Input**: Accepts a standardized expression matrix for genes, proteins, or metabolites.
- **Phenotype Analysis**: Leverages clinical phenotype data to pinpoint gene expressions associated with specific clinical conditions.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implements PCA algorithms and Euclidean distance measures to filter gene clusters.
- **Visualization Tools**: Includes three distinct methods for visualizing data and results.
- **Open Source**: Provides full access to its source code for extended flexibility and customization.

## Getting Started
